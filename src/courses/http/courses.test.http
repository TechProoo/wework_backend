The term was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, which is recognized as the birthplace of AI as a formal field of study.\n\nIn this lesson, you’ll explore the evolution of AI, from early rule-based systems to today’s data-driven neural networks. Key historical milestones include the creation of the first expert systems in the 1970s, the AI winters of the 1980s and 1990s, and the deep learning revolution in the 2010s driven by advances in computing power and data availability.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll understand the distinctions between narrow AI (task-specific systems) and general AI (human-level intelligence), and recognize major application areas such as robotics, healthcare, and finance.",

    "content": "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that can learn from and make predictions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for each task, ML models improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.\n\nThere are three main types of machine learning:\n1. **Supervised Learning** — Uses labeled data to train models for tasks like classification and regression. Examples include predicting housing prices or identifying spam emails.\n2. **Unsupervised Learning** — Discovers hidden structures in unlabeled data using methods like clustering (K-Means) or dimensionality reduction (PCA).\n3. **Reinforcement Learning** — Involves agents that learn to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties. This method powers systems like AlphaGo and robotic control algorithms.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you will understand key ML concepts like training, testing, overfitting, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.",

    "content": "Neural Networks are inspired by the human brain’s interconnected neurons. Each neuron receives input, processes it through an activation function, and passes it to the next layer. A network typically consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Training occurs via backpropagation — a process that adjusts weights to minimize error using gradient descent.\n\nDeep Learning expands on this by adding multiple hidden layers, allowing the model to learn complex hierarchical patterns. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image recognition tasks, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers are essential for sequential data such as language and speech.\n\nThis lesson also covers essential tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, which simplify the process of building and training deep learning models. You will learn the roles of GPUs, activation functions like ReLU and Softmax, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.",

Ethical issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability are central to AI governance. Biased training data can result in discriminatory systems, and the lack of transparency ('black box' models) raises concerns about fairness and trust.\n\nThis lesson also introduces the concept of **Explainable AI (XAI)**, which focuses on making model decisions interpretable.
